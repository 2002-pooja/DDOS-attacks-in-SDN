# Analysis of DDoS Attacks in SDN Environments

## Course : Internet Technology and Applications 
## Course code : CO368

### Overview :
#### SDN :
Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is an emerging architecture that is dynamic, manageable, cost-effective, and adaptable, making it ideal for the high-bandwidth, dynamic nature of todayâ€™s applications. This architecture decouples the network control and forwarding functions enabling the network control to become directly programmable and the underlying infrastructure to be abstracted for applications and network services.<br>

#### DDoS :
A Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack is a cyber-attack where the attacker seeks to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users by temporarily or indefinitely disrupting services of a host connected to the Internet. This is typically accomplished by flooding the target with superfluous requests in an attempt to overload systems.
In a Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack, the incoming traffic flooding the victim originates from many different sources. This effectively makes it impossible to stop the attack simply by blocking a single source.

### Steps to Reproduce 

Steps to reproduce along with the packages needed can be found [here](https://github.com/aswanthpp/Analysis-of-DDoS-Attacks-in-SDN-Environments/wiki/Steps-To-Reproduce)
